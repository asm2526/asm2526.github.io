                    <h2>Problem Staatement: Clothing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our users need a way to find clothing that they see celebreties on TV or strangers wearing in public. It is always frustrating when you see a TV actor wearing a shirt that you like, but it is impossible to find it online. Similarly, it is a daunting task in public to ask a stranger where they bought a certain piece of clothing.
